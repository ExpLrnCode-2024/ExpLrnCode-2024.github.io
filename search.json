Would you have used it?\nOR\nIf your lecturer had given you a skeleton code to start with, how would you have felt? Would you have used it?\n\nIs there something important about starting from a blank slate?\n\n\n\n4.3 What kinds of activities do you enjoy?\nNOTE: consider moving this after the specific project question, so that they can ‘surprise themself’ when they move onto the general question. This way round, the specific question could just be an elaboration on the general.\nWhat kinds of programming activities do you most enjoy?\n\nMore creative?\nMore problem-solving?\nDesign? User-facing? Showy?\nOr low-level, niche, technical?\nAre there any aspects of programming that you particulary dislike?\n\n\n\n4.4 Creativity\nWould you say programming is (a) building, (b) engineering, (c) crafting or (d) art?\n\nFeel creative?\nLike a blank slate and creative freedom?"

(e.g. general discourse, peer group, lecturers)\n\n\n\n6.7 GenAI for learning to code\nThinking back to when you first started learning to code, how do you think your experience would have been different had you been able to use generative AI tools?\n\nHow so?\nWhat do you think about the idea of introducing generative AI into introductory programming courses?\nDo you think there is any role for generative AI to play in helping people learn to code? If so, what is it?\nWhat if the overall difficulty of the courses was increased?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwn experience bias\n\n\n\n\n\nProbable bias towards their own experience being preferable.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8 GenAI and career plans\nHas generative AI changed the way you think about your ambitions for a career at all?\n\nHave you changed your mind about anything because of it?\nHas it changed the way you think about the future in any other way, not necessarily related to your career?"

Before you decide whether or not to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully. Ask questions if anything is not clear or you would like more information.\n\n\nThe purpose of this project is to help teachers and researchers better understand students’ experiences of learning to code and developing as programmers, by asking the students themselves.\nThis is a research project, and we intend to submit an article based on our findings to a peer-reviewed journal.\nThe nature of the research is exploratory. Our goal is to uncover a range of experiences and perspectives, not to formally test any hypotheses or make generalisable claims.\nWe expect that teaching staff at the University of Edinburgh take an interest in our findings. However, it is important to understand that teaching staff will not know which students have taken part in the study, and that taking part will have no effect whatsoever on your grades.\n\n\n\nWe are inviting participants to take part in a one-to-one interview over Microsoft Teams. These will be more like a conversation than a formal interview; we are interested to hear about your experiences, not to judge you!\nThe interview will be conducted by one of our three researchers, who are familiar with the courses but are not involved in any teaching at the University.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interview will be recorded and transcribed using Microsoft Teams’ automatic transcriptions. This recording is saved automatically within Teams, using the University of Edinburgh’s cloud storage provided by Microsoft Office 365. You can read the privacy document here.\nAfter the interview, the interviewer will listen back to the recording and perform a series of actions to ensure that the resulting transcript is accurate, and that any identifiable information has been removed:\n\nThey will double-check that the automatic transcription is accurate, and correct it where appropriate.\nThey will change any mentioned names to pseudonyms (fake names) to protect identities.\nThey will redact any portions of the transcript that contain information that may be used to identify an individual, be they a student or a teacher, taking care to preserve the original meaning of what was said wherever possible.\n\nThe modified, redacted transcript will then be downloaded, and the original interview recording and transcript deleted.\n\n\n\nThe redacted interview transcripts will be interpreted and analysed qualitatively by the interviewer and the Research Assistants.\nWhen it comes to reporting on our findings, where appropriate, we may include selected quotes from the redacted versions of the interview transcripts in order to illustrate themes or concepts.\n\n\n\n\nWe have identified the main risks to student participants as resulting from the identification of individuals in the study by teaching staff. For example, the participant could discuss a moment in which cheating occurred during assessed work, and if the Course Organiser found out they might be tempted to take action or treat the participant unfavourably in future.\nFor this reason, we have strict protocols in place to ensure that all participants remain anonymous to any teaching staff. These include\n\nThe fact that the interviewer is the only person who knows the identity of the participants, and has no involvement in teaching.\nThe way that interview transcripts are redacted to ensure anonymity.\nThe immediate deletion of the original interview and transcript after the redacted version has been completed.\n\nOur judgement is that, with these protocols in place, the possibility of a negative outcome for participants is extremely minimal.\n\n\n\nYes. You will receive a £20 Amazon gift voucher which will be sent to the email address you provided shortly (we anticipate within 1-2 weeks) after your interview.\n\n\n\nYou have the right to withdraw consent for your data to be used after your interview, provided you let us know within a time frame that makes opting out practically possible. Ideally, this would be within one week of your interview, but sooner is better.\n\nWithin one week of your interview: If you withdraw consent within one week of your interview we guarantee that none of the information you provide will be used. All of your data, including anonymised and redacted transcript, will be deleted immediately.\nMore than one week after your interview: If you withdraw consent more than one week after your interview there is a high chance that we have already invested considerable time transcribing and analysing the information you provided, and it becomes increasingly difficult to extract and disregard your data. However, upon your instruction we will not use quotes from your interview in any published work.\nFrom late October 2024 onwards: Please understand that it will not be possible to opt out once we have submitted our article for publication in late October.\n\nYou may also request that certain parts of your interview are not quoted.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions that you feel have not been sufficiently answered above, please reach out to Joe Marsh Rossney at jmarshr@exseed.ed.ac.uk.\nPlease do not contact other staff members about this project, since it is important that any participants remain anonymous to teaching staff.\nHowever, if you have an ethical concern that you would like to raise with someone other than Joe Marsh Rossney, you can contact the school’s ethics officer at ethics@ph.ed.ac.uk.\n\nI have read and understood the above and wish to continue to the Informed Consent form. *\n\n\nYes\nNo"

Ideally, this would be within one week of your interview, but sooner is better.\n\nWithin one week of your interview: If you withdraw consent within one week of your interview we guarantee that none of the information you provide will be used. All of your data, including anonymised and redacted transcript, will be deleted immediately.\nMore than one week after your interview: If you withdraw consent more than one week after your interview there is a high chance that we have already invested considerable time transcribing and analysing the information you provided, and it becomes increasingly difficult to extract and disregard your data. However, upon your instruction we will not use quotes from your interview in any published work.\nFrom late October 2024 onwards: Please understand that it will not be possible to opt out once we have submitted our article for publication in late October.\n\nYou may also request that certain parts of your interview are not quoted.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions that you feel have not been sufficiently answered above, please reach out to Joe Marsh Rossney at jmarshr@exseed.ed.ac.uk.\nPlease do not contact other staff members about this project, since it is important that any participants remain anonymous to teaching staff.\nHowever, if you have an ethical concern that you would like to raise with someone other than Joe Marsh Rossney, you can contact the school’s ethics officer at ethics@ph.ed.ac.uk.\n\nI have read and understood the above and wish to continue to the Informed Consent form. *\n\n\nYes\nNo"

The essential aim of this project is to produce primary evidence from students' perspectives to inform planned course redevelopments motivated by similar aims, both within the SoPA and more widely.\nThe main inquiry will take the form of a series of interviews with ~25 student participants, whose experiences span the periods before and after the advent of GenAI. Additionally, we will take a global snapshot of student attitudes towards GenAI and our programming courses using a survey.\nThe insights will feed into the development of a set of guidelines and recommendations aimed at Course Organisers. Anticipating a wider relevance than the courses we are directly involved with, we will take steps to disseminate the findings of our study among colleagues in the SoPA, the broader University community, and further afield. The key results will be submitted for publication in a Focused Collection of the peer-reviewed journal Physical Review Physics Education Research. Finally, this study will serve as a baseline and potentially a blueprint for follow-up work as the technological landscape evolves."

    "title": "Project Proposal",
    "section": "3 Background",
    "text": "3 Background\n\n3.1 Context\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) refers to a recent technological innovation which has produced systems that are capable of generating high-fidelity, contextual and multi-modal outputs in response to complex natural language inputs. What makes the GenAI revolution unprecedented is its enormous transformative potential in the hands of ordinary citizens, combined with breakneck speed at which it has been able to realise that potential on a global scale. OpenAI's ChatGPT was the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million monthly active users within two months of its launch in November 2022. All indicators point to GenAI becoming increasingly prevalent in future societies, where it is expected to become deeply integrated in the knowledge economy.\nA recent UNESCO report titled Guidance for generative AI in education and research (Fengchun & Holmes, 2023) emphasised the unpreparedness of educational institutions for overseeing validation, integration and regulation of GenAI systems for educational purposes. This is underlined by the many divergent responses among individual educators and educational institutions (Xiao et al., 2023).\nOver the last year, each of the programming courses in the SoPA have had different policies towards the use of GenAI, reflecting the different instincts of the Course Organiser(s). Some courses have imposed a strict ban on the use of GenAI to generate code submitted for assessment, treating it as a form of plagiarism and punishable with a mark of zero. Meanwhile other courses have taken a light-touch approach, allowing GenAI while attempting to convey its inherent limitations to students.\nGiven the lack of empirical evidence to support any given policy, this diversity is not necessarily a bad thing. However, there is consensus among Course Organisers that programming courses must be urgently updated, or at least the emphasis reconfigured, to give students a clarity of purpose and a more consistent experience as they progress through their studies.\n\n\n3.2 Research Gap\nThere is unfortunately a dearth of high-quality empirical evidence available to guide educators towards incorporating GenAI into programming courses. Recent contributions to the academic literature have highlighted important considerations (Becker et al., 2023), but guidance aimed at educators is often generic – \"AI can produce inaccurate content\" – or, more worryingly, produced on behalf of 'EdTech' companies with vested commercial interests (Williamson, 2023).\nEven more scarce are studies that focus on the student perspective. In this respect, the composition of current undergraduate students in the School of Physics and Astronomy is uniquely diverse; there are students who took the full set of programming courses without GenAI, others who took introductory courses without GenAI but have used it during advanced courses, and new students who are currently taking introductory courses with GenAI and have never known any different. This opens up a one-time opportunity to gather primary data from the perspectives of students for whom the sudden appearance of GenAI directly impacted their ongoing undergraduate experience, potentially affecting their attitudes, learning practices, and future outlook and career ambitions.\n\n\n3.3 Theoretical Influences\nA pragmatists' perspective on the overarching purpose of higher education is that it should equip the learner with a suite of experiences, technical skills and knowledge, and ill-defined 'higher-order' cognitive abilities that can be drawn on to engage with complex real-world issues and unseen challenges. We take it as axiomatic that these 'abilities' are emergent properties of slow, complex, and frequently self-driven processes loosely labelled 'deep learning' (McGregor, 2020). Our main substantive interest is in understanding where GenAI has the potential to enhance or disrupt deep learning processes, and thereby identify practical measures we can take to meet an optimal balance between deep learning and raw skill acquisition.\nThe themes we have singled out as likely indicators of deep learning are grounded in cognitive psychology. We furthermore build on a body of educational research concerned with project-based learning, owing to the fact that the majority of the programming courses in SoPA revolve around project work. In particular, empirical studies have identified features associated with a sense of ownership of one's work that positively correlate with hallmarks of deep learning - see Hanauer & Dolan (2014) and references therein. Given the popular framing of GenAI systems not as tools but as 'assistants' and 'collaborators', we aim to establish whether this is reflected in students self-reported feelings of ownership towards their coding projects.\n\n\n3.4 Wider relevance\nAlthough our study is situated within the SoPA, the difficulties of accommodating GenAI in existing courses with established forms of teaching and assessment are felt across disciplines. Arguably the programming courses offered by the SoPA are a good testing ground for a more general enquiry, being highly attended by students majoring in mathematics, chemistry, informatics, engineering and subjects further afield. This reflects the fact that these have been and continue to be high-value courses for a wide range of students whose interests, prior skills and life goals may be very different, and underscores the importance of a granular approach. Our enquiry is also based around broad themes, to be introduced shortly, that characterise general learning experiences, and are not specific to physics or to programming. We therefore expect any findings from our proposed study to resonate far more widely than one might otherwise expect."

    "title": "Project Proposal",
    "section": "4 Methodology",
    "text": "4 Methodology\n\n4.1 Data collection\nThe understudied nature of the topic demands a flexible and student-oriented approach to information gathering. The main source of primary data will therefore be a series of semi-structured interviews with a sample of approximately 25 student participants from the full range of year-groups. Interviews will be broadly guided towards an exploration of several key themes, identified a priori, while being responsive to new themes emerging from the student participants. A non-exhaustive list of the themes we intend to explore includes ownership (including agency, individuality, aesthetic, pride), affective state (enjoyment, boredom, frustration, epiphany), higher-order thinking (strategic thinking, connectivity), peer group (peer support & competition), and wider context (motivations, aspirations, future planning).\nThe process of recruiting the first round of student interviewees will originate with a short ~3 minute Jisc survey, sent to students' university email accounts, which will feature a tick-box to indicate that a student is willing to participate in an interview in exchange for a £20 gift voucher. From this initial pool of candidate interviewees we will select approximately 5 students for the first round of interviews, giving preference to those graduating this summer. The survey provides a secondary opportunity for data collection on a larger scale, which we will use to take a snapshot of student attitudes towards GenAI in relation to our programming courses. This will help to contextualise our conclusions from the interviews and establishes a baseline for future longitudinal studies.\nThe second round of interviewees will be recruited during the first week of the Autumn semester. The RA will stand alongside a temporary display in the James Clerk Maxwell Building foyer, where most students enter and exit. On this display or table there will be information about our project and a QR code for interested students to sign up. On this sign-up page there will be an option to respond to a prompt question, which we hope will help to select a group of interviewees with diverse perspectives.\n\n\n4.2 Analysis\nInterviews will be transcribed and coded: portions of text containing pertinent information will be 'tagged' with one or more discrete codes that correspond to ideas or themes contained therein, with a new code created every time a new theme or idea is encountered. The analysis will be guided by qualitative studies with a similar aim of understanding student attitudes towards their development as learners (Stanley et al., 2015; Thiry et al., 2011). The results of the analysis will be presented, where possible, such as to shed light on the following questions:\n1. How do students understand their position/purpose/identity as programmers in light of GenAI?\n2. How do students view their past/present/future studies in light of GenAI? In particular, which elements of SoPA's programming courses were most valuable or formative?\n3. Are there marked differences in the experiences and perspectives of students who took the same programming courses with and without use and/or awareness of GenAI?\nRaw survey data will be processed and represented by visualisations and summary statistics.\n\n\n4.3 Epistemological standpoint\nInterviews will be conducted, transcribed and analysed by a Research Assistant (JMR) with recent, first-hand experience of relevant programming courses as both a student (2014-18) and instructor (2019-23). Their proximity to the student experience is central to the justification of an interpretivist analysis, which aims to 'read between the lines' and tease out meaning from complex responses.\nJMR is also supervising two undergraduate students' summer projects which share the theme of generative AI in university teaching. Although these students will focus on their own independent scholarship-funded projects, they have expressed a keen interest in the project proposed here. We are therefore considering the possibility that these students could have some modest involvement, potentially as beta-testers for the interviews and providing 'quality control' on the post-interview analysis.\n\n\n4.4 Data Privacy and Ethics\nThe survey will not request information on ethnicity since such information can be used to identify individuals within such a small population. We will instead ask survey respondents to indicate whether they are a UK student or an international student. Students will be asked to sign a consent form to indicate that they are happy for their interview to be recorded and analysed, and for segments of the interview to anonymously quoted in the write-up. The original recordings will be deleted after transcription, and the transcriptions will be redacted to remove identifiable, sensitive or irrelevant information before the coding is performed."

The conclusions of our study will therefore be of substantive interest in and of themselves, which is why we intend to put them forward for wider dissemination via a peer reviewed journal.\nAt the same time, our primary motivation for this research is the need to update the suite of programming courses in the School of Physics and Astronomy. Drawing on our depth of experience and insights gained from our study, we will create a set of guidelines and recommendations aimed at assisting Course Organisers (ourselves included). Due to the magnitude and ongoing nature of these changes we anticipate the need for an adaptive, multi-stage process of course redevelopment. We feel it is important to ensure that the student voice is listened to from the very start of this process.\nThe University of Edinburgh is a global leader in education research, and the School of Physics and Astronomy stands among a very small number of UK institutions with a dedicated research group in tertiary physics education. This project will underline our reputation for high-quality, timely research, and we fully expect there to be wider interest in the results of our study among other universities."

A pre-print version of this same article will also be published immediately upon completion on the open-access repository arXiv in the physics.ed-ph section. Our article proposal has so far made it through the first review stage, but if we are not accepted into this edition of PRPER we will seek to publish in another peer-reviewed journal.\n\n\n7.2 Blog\nJMR will chronicle the project via a series of blog posts hosted on GitHub and freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection. The blog format allows for more a more granular and reflective account of the project, and it will be written with the intention of being maximally useful to future studies. The blog will include (i) a review of key literature, (ii) a methodological toolkit, and (iii) a narrative account of being a researcher from a STEM discipline leading a project based on the collection and subjective interpretation of qualitative data. JMR will condense the highlights from the standalone blog into a guest blog post for the Teaching Matters blog. This will include links to the published material and standalone blog. A project homepage will be created within the SoPA webpages to help direct people to the published paper and the blog.\n\n\n7.3 Seminars & Presentations\nWe will hold an internal seminar with the key staff in SoPA to share and discuss the findings from our study. This will occur during the Summer break, giving sufficient time for Course Organisers to operationalise our findings in time for the Autumn semester. On their request, JMR will give a guest seminar in the newly-formed Computer Science Education group in the School of Informatics.\nWe will also seek out further dissemination opportunities, e.g. in the School of Education and the Edinburgh Futures Institute. Finally, JMR intends to travel the next iteration of the National Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education, which has been held at Ulster University in January the last two years, to present the results of our study to a wider audience. Alternatively, we anticipate many suitable conferences in which our study can be disseminated throughout the summer conference season of 2025."

    "text": "8 Updates & response to PTAS panel feedback\n\n8.1 Related PTAS Project\n\n“Your proposal has some similarities to another PTAS project in Informatics led by Pavlos Andreadis. Please contact Pavlos to see if there are any productive crossovers between your two projects and also to ensure clear differentiation between your two projects. Describe to the PTAS committee, how each project will contribute uniquely.”\n\nWe are grateful to the PTAS panel for alerting us to Dr Andreadis’ and collaborators’ project. This project also focuses on the integration of GenAI into programming courses, though there are marked differences between our projects in focus, methodology and scope. In light of these differences we view our two projects as complementary rather than equivalent.\nDr Andreadis’ and collaborators’ project aims to develop a ‘living document’ serving as a source of reference and a methodological ‘toolkit’ for educators, covering a broad range of issues related to the integration of GenAI into the teaching and learning of programming. They will seek input from both teachers and students in the Schools of Informatics, Mathematics and the Business School, through large-scale surveys and focus groups.\nWe remark on some key ways in which our project differs from Dr Andreadis’. Essentially, whereas Dr Andreadis’ project aims to be holistic and seeks input from as many sources as possible, ours is narrowly focused on the detail and nuance of individual student experiences. We expect students to voice perspectives that challenge those of teachers, and thus the findings from interviews are intended to be used as ‘guardrails’ and ‘quality control’ which will feed into but not constitute guidance for Course Organisers. We argue that one-to-one interviews can probe different aspects of the student experience than surveys and focus groups, and therefore that our approaches are complementary and can serve as cross-validation for each other. Another important difference between the two projects is that we are particularly interested in the cohort whose undergraduate studies spanned the period in which GenAI became popularised, whereas the student-oriented component of Dr Andreadis' study appears to have a more explicit feed-forward structure whereby students in earlier year-groups are encouraged to come forward and influence their own future learning experience.\nAfter a discussion with Dr Andreadis, we have mutually agreed to maintain regular communication over the duration of our projects. We have furthermore provisionally agreed to the following collaborative activities:\n\nOur team may contribute a chapter to the ‘toolkit’ being created by Dr Andreadis and collaborators, based on the findings from our study and the guidelines we develop for the School of Physics & Astronomy.\nWe will regularly attend the seminar series being organised by Dr Andreadis and colleagues in the School of Informatics, and we have been kindly offered space to present both interim and final conclusive results from our study.\nWe will promote the toolkit in the School of Physics & Astronomy, especially among other Course Organisers of programming courses.\n\n\n\n8.2 Ethics Approval\n\n“Please confirm that approval has been obtained or will be obtained before the research commences.”\n\nWe can confirm that we have obtained ethics approval for this project from the School of Physics & Astronomy, in line with Universities UK Concordat on Integrity, CSE and UKRI policies.\n\n\n8.3 Timeframe & Budget\n\n“The committee felt that the current timeframe was too short for the scope of the proposed work, especially with an April 2024 start. We would like you to extend the timeframe for project and should consider adding 3-4 months to the current timeframe to enable all work to be completed.”\n\nWe agree that the original time-frame was optimistic. We propose that the start date is postponed to June 1st and the project duration is extended by 3 months to cover the Autumn semester 2024. In addition to allowing more time to do the research thoroughly, this has the advantage that the bulk of the interviews may be conducted during the semester where students are present on-campus.\nJMR will not be able to continue as RA from September 1st. However, we have found an excellent candidate to take over this role for the remaining four months of the project. This individual, who will graduate with a Bachelors degree this summer, is enthusiastic and highly capable; by the time they take over they will have already completed two research projects on the topic of GenAI and teaching – their Bachelors thesis and a summer research placement under the supervision of JMR. There will be a seamless handover at the end of August, and JMR will remain available to provide support and guidance throughout the remainder of the project duration.\n\n“Revisit and revise the budget. Add additional research assistant costs for extending the timeframe.”\n\nWe have added an additional three months of stipend for part-time RA work, on top of the four months originally requested. We have adjusted the pay grade in line with standard pay for PDRAs and PGRAs in SoPA.\n\n“The budget details no costs for interview transcription. Please add these if necessary. If not necessary, please indicate why this isn’t required.”\n\nThe RA will do the transcribing so these costs are contained within the RA's stipend. Automated transcription software will be used to create a first approximation of a transcript, which the RA will then check, edit and format while listening to the audio recording. We feel that this approach strikes a reasonable balance between time-efficiency and the analytical benefits of the researcher doing the transcribing themselves. We will only use transcription software for which we are completely satisfied that the input data is secure, i.e. not used for any other purposes and deleted once the transcription is finished.\n\n“Add costs for dissemination, in particular conference attendance is mentioned in the application. Please add costs if this is required.”\n\nWe have listed several ways in which we will disseminate our research both within and outside of the University. The majority of these do not come with a cost. However, we would like to send a member of our team to deliver a presentation at a dedicated conference for AI in Higher Education in 2025. There are several such conferences held in Europe each year (e.g. the National Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education mentioned previously), but at this point dates and conference fees for 2025 have not been publicised. Based on the fees for this years' conferences, we have requested £1000, which includes an estimate of £500 for accommodation and travel. Should we end up requiring less than £1000 we will happily return the remaining money to PTAS.\nOur proposed article has passed first review and is currently under second review for the Physical Review Physics Education Research journal. This is a 'Gold' open-access journal and should our article be accepted for publication the cost of publishing will be $1430 (approximately £1126). Should our proposal be rejected we will submit it to another peer-reviewed journal which will likely have similar publishing costs.\n\n\n8.4 Responses to additional comments\n\n“Would an element of anonymity be useful? Will students who have engaged with courses where AI was banned be honest about their views?”\n\nWe agree! The student interviewees will be entirely anonymous from the perspective of teaching staff at the University. Only the RAs, who will not have further teaching duties beyond the end of this project, will know their identity. As stated previously, we will ensure that interviewees fully understand this, and the way in which their data will be anonymised, prior to the interview.\nThe information gathered in interviews will not be used to ‘check for cheating’ in courses that are in progress. There is little risk of this since none of our team are involved in courses which impose a strict ban on GenAI.\nFor the survey, we will also keep students anonymous. This means we can ask them to fill in general information such as their year group and preferred gender, but we will refrain from asking for information on ethnicity or any other characteristics that might identify individuals when corroborated.\n\n“The relationship between the survey and the interviews is not clear – will the survey be informed by the interviews?”\n\nOur intention is for the survey to inform the interviews, rather than vice versa. The interviews are really the main focus of this study, but we hope that a survey on a larger scale may draw our attention to areas where we lack granular understanding, and hence help us to design interviews that probe these areas. Other than that we view the survey as a means of cross-validation for the interviews, and as a second line of defence against over-generalisation of our findings.\nWe originally meant to recruit all interviewees via this initial survey. However, with the extended time-frame we can now recruit by speaking directly to students in the Physics department during the first week of the semester, which we expect to have a higher success rate. We still aim to recruit a small number of students who are graduating this summer from the initial survey.\n\n“How will student interviewees be selected to ensure appropriate representation?”\n\nWe have discussed this issue at length in the ‘Methods and Evaluation’ section, although it is fair to observe that we have not detailed a strategy for selection. We will select a cross-section of year groups and genders – that is the relatively easy part. If we were collecting a larger sample, we would use some selection algorithm that pools candidate interviewees into ‘like’ groups and randomly selects a representative number from each group. However, since we are looking at a small sample we feel it is preferable to rely on our judgement in selecting interviewees, seeking a broad range of perspectives based on responses to an initial question prompt when students sign up as candidate interviewees."

The funds requested include a stipend for part-time research at standard pay grades for PDRAs and PGRAs in SoPA. We believe that offering incentives to participate in surveys is worth the relatively low cost, since we are more likely to have greater sign-up and hence ability to select a more representative sample. We have budgeted for the cost of a single member of our team attending and presenting our work at a conference, which is a reasonable balance between keeping costs low while effectively drawing attention to our work and the enhancing the University’s reputation in a highly topical area of research."

    "text": "10 Project team expertise\n\n10.1 Joe Marsh Rossney\nI recently completed a PhD in SoPA where my research was on GenAI applications in particle physics. I am an Associate Fellow of the Advanced Higher Education Academy (now Advance HE) and am currently in the final stages of the Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice (PgCAP) programme taught by the Institute for Academic Development here in Edinburgh. I have been a teaching assistant on various courses in SoPA since 2020, including two programming courses, and more recently I have been working as a teaching assistant in the Edinburgh Futures Institute on two courses themed around the ethics of data and AI. Before coming to Edinburgh I was a teaching assistant at a secondary school where my primary role was providing additional support for students with special educational needs. My interest in technology in education is longstanding, but I came up with the idea for this particular project while taking the ‘Researching Your Teaching’ course as part of the PgCAP. I do not have prior experience with qualitative research, other than creating and analysing an end-of-course survey, but I am committed to learning and improving ‘on the job’, which will include asking for help where help is needed.\n\n\n10.2 Ross Galloway\nI am a Senior Lecturer in SoPA and also the leader of the school’s Physics Education Research (PER) Group. I have over 20 years’ experience in the teaching of physics and astronomy at the HE level, and 15 years of experience as a disciplinary-based pedagogical researcher. My previous projects in PER have incorporated quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods approaches, so I am well-versed in the methods to be used in this project. As a former Director of Teaching within SoPA, I had oversight of some of the challenges around the rapid influx of GenAI into the undergraduate sphere, and also questions of how to coherently respond at course, programme and school level.\n\n\n10.3 Britton Smith\nI am a Reader in the Institute for Astronomy in SoPA at University of Edinburgh. I am currently the Course Organizer for Computer Simulation, an introductory Python course focusing on object-oriented programming to model physical phenomena. This course has roughly 180 first- and second-year undergraduate students. In the past year, I have witnessed a major shift in the way students undertake programming exercises in this course, away from peer interaction and toward consultation of GenAI. The results of this study will have direct and considerable impact on this course. I am very interested to understand how students perceive the value of learning code development amidst the rise of GenAI and how I can continue to make the course feel relevant to them."

    "text": "11 Equality impact statement\n\n11.1 Project Team\nThe diversity of our project team is limited by a combination of staff availability and a more fundamental homogeneity of the people involved in the delivery of our programming courses. It would be very beneficial if the project team were as diverse as the students; we are mindful of the risk of designing a study that reproduces the biases inevitably present in our priors. In particular, with the interview format knowledge is co-created by both the interviewer and interviewee, so having multiple interviewers with different backgrounds and personalities would be helpful. We note that we have had, and intend to continue to have, discussions with interested colleagues and students who are not listed on the project team. That is to say there are established channels from which we can receive input from more diverse perspectives.\n\n\n11.2 Participation and involvement\nWe do not expect there to be a barrier that disfavours under-represented groups in terms of their willingness to volunteer as interviewees, other than potentially a reluctance or scepticism about being interviewed (by a white man), which may be felt unequally. In agreeing to be interviewed, or even filling out a survey, the students are entrusting the researchers with their ‘data’, some which may be personal and sensitive. It is important that we are not just vigilant about the privacy aspects of the study, but also transparent so that students feel able to trust us. By holding some interviews over Microsoft Teams we do unfortunately lose some nuances afforded by in-person interviews, but some students will prefer this format. This is particularly true for the initial interviews, which take place outside of term time; a journey onto campus for a single interview may be very inconvenient for e.g. students with disabilities or work commitments.\n\n\n11.3 Methods or Evaluation\nIt is highly plausible that the experiences and perspectives of students towards programming and GenAI are differentiated along intersection lines. Both physics and programming are fields that have historically been dominated by white western men, and this historical and cultural fact permeates into the experiences of current students to varying degrees. As an example, it may emerge from our study that non-dominant groups (e.g. women) report different social experiences in the computer labs, which may lead them to appreciate GenAI as a ‘non-judgemental’ assistant.\nHaving recognised this, it is important to stress that the methods proposed in this study come with substantial risks of drawing conclusions that are systematically biased in a way that potentially harms certain under-represented groups. Any sample-based methods have the potential to suffer from non-generalisability, and the researcher has a duty to guard against over-extrapolating results from small or unrepresentative samples. From a statistical perspective, in the former case the theoretical statistical errors are large and in the latter case results will be biased in a way that is generally impossible to ‘correct’ post-hoc.\nWe make no claim to guarantee a truly representative sample – indeed it is probably a fallacy to imagine that such a thing exists. It would be ideal if students from a wide range of backgrounds put themselves forward for interview, but cherry-picking individual students comes with its own ethical issues. Even with an apparently representative sample, it would be dangerous to take a very small number of people with a particular characteristic, e.g. religion or ethnicity, as somehow representative of all people sharing that characteristic. This comes back to the fact that, in studies such as ours, one cannot abstain from a subjective, holistic analysis by appealing to statistical arguments. The main tool we have to protect the integrity of our study and the well-being of students is our full engagement with the complexity and intangibility of the questions we have posed.\nAs discussed in the ‘Method’ section, identifiable information from the interviews and survey will not be included in the analysis. While our intention is to include certain characteristics such as gender in the analysis, we are committed to protecting the anonymity of interviewees and will take necessary precautions.\n\n\n11.4 Sharing your findings\nWe have laid out a suite of dissemination strategies that include textual reports and oral presentations. We are fully committed to open accessibility of our project outputs, which will be available online with zero further access requirements. We feel it is important to not only publish the final results but also detail the process in a way that can be used to critique or replicate the work in future, which motivates the inclusion of a blog on top of a traditional scholarly article. We will not publish full transcripts from the interviews, though some suitably redacted snippets will be included within the main report."

They will have to do this now, while you wait (though it shouldn’t take long).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf the student has not completed the Informed Consent Form you cannot proceed with the interview!\n\n\n\nAsk them if they have any questions.\nAsk them if they are happy to move onto the interview and for you to start the recording.\nStart the recording by going to More &gt; Record and transcribe &gt; Start recording. This should start both the recording and transcription, but you should double check by opening the live transcription in the sidebar.\nAsk the student to confirm, for the recording, that they have read the Participant Information Sheet and completed the Informed Consent Form.\n\n\n\n3.2 Tips for during the interview\nAt this point you are ready to start the interview proper, for which you will want to refer to the Interview Guide.\nSome general tips:\n\nIf your screen is large enough, keep the guide next to the Teams window, or somewhere that you can read it without making it obvious that you are looking somewhere other than at the student.\nIt can be very annoying when a student’s speech is split into multiple chunks in the transcript that are separated by the interviewer making noises (“yeah”, “ok”, “mmm”) that register as speech. You can help as an interviewer by not making noises while the interviewee is speaking. Consider using purely-visual indicators to show the student you are listening, such as nodding or frowning thoughtfully.\nTry to ask questions directly, clearly and succinctly. The style should be conversational and feel natural, but try to keep question preambles and ad-libbed speech fairly short. Partly this is because the more you say the greater the chance that you will accidentally say something you didn’t mean to.\nKeep it professional, non-judgemental and try to maintain a balanced and neutral stance on issues if possible.\nDo not bring your personal experiences or opinions into the conversation. Try to redict any questions about your personal opinions in a polite but firm way.\n\n\n\n3.3 Ending the interview\n\nStop the recording.\nThank the student once more for their time.\nRemind them that they will receive their voucher by email in the next few weeks.\nCheck with the student that they know how to get in touch with you if they have further questions about the project or things to add.\nSay goodbye and end the meeting."

    "section": "4 After the interview",
    "text": "4 After the interview\n\n4.1 Immediately after the interview\n\n4.1.1 Record your immediate impressions\nThe first and most important thing to do is to note down your immediate impressions from the interview. Reflexive thoughts are equally if not more valuable at this time than analytical ones.\nFor example, you could make a note of:\n\nAny parts of the interview that felt particularly interesting or productive\nAnything that jumped out at you as interesting or unusual\nAny parts of the interview that did not go so well, and why\nReflections on how you could have improved the interview, e.g. by following up on something or wording something differently\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Post-interview cleanup\nOnce you are happy that you’ve gotten your thoughts down, go to the Chat section of Teams. The most recent chat should contain the recording and transcript of the interview (the transcript might take some time to appear).\nClick on View recap, and then on Open in Stream in the top-right of the window (underneath Join). This should open Microsoft Stream in a new tab.\nThere are two things to do here:\n\nOn the top-right, click the red-pink drop-down menu next to Copy link, click on Manage access and then ‘stop sharing’ with the student.\nIn the top left, rename the video with the case ID (e.g. Student F).\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Rewatching and editing the transcript\nThe meeting transcript generated by Teams is a reasonable starting point, for out purposes at least. However, it will inevitably contain errors, ommissions and bad grammar, and may also contain passages that could be used to identify an individual. Fortunately it is possible to edit the generated transcript in situ using the Stream app. To edit a block of transcript in Stream you just need to click on it, make the edits, then hit enter to save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe under no illusions: the way we are transcribing these interviews would not be considered ‘good practice’ by qualitative researchers. This is a legitimate criticism of our work, to which my response can be summarised as\n\nWe simply did not have time/funds to transcribe every interview by hand and in full detail.\nWe are not doing a ‘deep’ sociological or linguistic analysis — this is a bit of a straw man, but the missing detail in the transcripts is unlikely to make a differnece to the kinds of claims we will make based on this data.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Transcription errors\nIf you try to correct every grammatical error this will take an extremely long time. Focus your effort on making edits that correct serious transcriptions errors or omissions, or clarify passages that would be very confusing to parse without the accompanying audio/video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe most essential transcription errors to correct are those that, if left alone, would pose a risk of mis-representing what the student said.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Redactions\nYou must redact information that could be used to identify an individual. Clearly this means redacting the names of individuals, but may also mean redacting the names of courses, places, organisations, details of projects, etc.\nYou can redact some text by replacing it with an informative placeholder within square brackets. To give some examples,\n&gt; My mate Dave did his project with Professor Thompson...\n&gt; Where I come from in Finland we study...\n&gt; Last summer I did an internship with Rockstar Games...\nbecomes\n&gt; My mate [name] did his project with [professor's name]...\n&gt; Where I come from in [European country] we study...\n&gt; Last summer I did an internship with [company]...\n\n\n4.2.3 Transcribing other elements of speech\nIt might seem appropriate to include things such as false starts or abrupt cutoffs, pauses, non-verbal sounds and facial expressions in the transcript, since these can help to paint a more detailed, accurate representation of the interaction as it really happened.\nWhen doing so, please follow the conventions described by the University of Toronto.\nNote that ‘umms’ and ‘errs’ are not transcribed by convention, which is fortunate for us since Teams tends not to transcribe them.\n\n\n4.2.4 Analysis\nRewatching the interview can and should serve dual purposes; as well as making corrections to the transcript, you should treat this as an opportunity for analysis. During this process you can make notes underneath those you made immediately after the interview.\n\n\n\n4.3 Downloading and formatting the transcript\nWhen you are happy with the corrections and redactions you have made on Stream, download the interview transcript to a secure location on your computer, choosing the .vtt format.\nIf you open this file in any text editor (e.g. notepad) you will see that it looks something like this:\nWEBVTT\n\n91b3f3c3-44c6-4a8b-8c0a-add105d816bd/32-0\n00:00:10.087 --&gt; 00:00:13.130\n&lt;v Name of Interviewer&gt;Something you said, probably\nweirdly split over two lines.&lt;/v&gt;\n\n91b3f3c3-44c6-4a8b-8c0a-add105d816bd/32-1\n00:00:13.130 --&gt; 00:00:16.270\n&lt;v Name of Student&gt;Something the student said\nin response.&lt;/v&gt;\n\n91b3f3c3-44c6-4a8b-8c0a-add105d816bd/32-2\n00:00:16.270 --&gt; 00:00:18.927\n&lt;v Name of Interviewer&gt;Now it's you speaking again.&lt;/v&gt;\n\n...\n\n4.3.1 Removing the student’s name\nThe most glaring problem is that the name of the student is still present — we could not change that on Teams/Stream.\nIdeally you would run a search-and-replace on this file to replace all instances of Name of Student with their case ID, i.e. Student X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf your computer runs on Linux or MacOS and you’re comfortable running a shell script, you can do this with sed.\nsed -i 's/Name of Student/Student X/g' student_X.vtt\n\n\nHowever, the tool we will use next to format the transcript can also do the search-and-replace, so you can skip this step as long as you do the formatting step straight away (so that the file containing the student’s name does not sit on your computer for very long).\n\n\n4.3.2 Formatting the transcript\nThe formatting tool is a Python script which can be found at github.com/ExpLrnCode-2024/teams-transcript-formatter along with instructions for use.\nI strongly recommend that you then create a virtual environment with Python 3.11 or higher, using either conda or venv, before installing the tool. I’m afraid I cannot provide reliable instructions for doing this on Windows (but we talked about it in person)!\npython -m pip install git+https://github.com/ExpLrnCode-2024/teams-transcript-formatter\nIn your working directory (which may be the folder containing the transcript), you should create a file called .env which contains a singe line INTERVIEWER=\"Your Name\" where Your Name is as it appears in the transcript. You can also do this by running the command\ndotenv set INTERVIEWER \"Your Name\"\nNow run the script,\nformat-transcripts student_X.vtt\nand it should produce a file called student_X_formatted.txt. Open this file in your text editor, and check that it looks something like\n\nInterviewer (00:10):\n    Something you said, probably weirdly split over two lines.\n\nStudent (00:13):\n    Something the student said in response.\n\nInterviewer (00:16):\n    Now it's you speaking again\n\n...\nIf this has not worked, get in touch with me!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou should now delete the original .vtt file from your computer, since it contains the name of the interviewee! (Unless you removed it yourself)\n\n\nThis file should not be ready for further analysis in QualCoder.\n\n\n\n4.4 Deleting the interview recording and transcript\nAccording to the University of Edinburgh’s Privacy Statement the recording and transcript from a Teams meeting will be deleted automatically after 700 days.2\nThat is, however, far longer than necessary for our purposes. Moreover, GDPR dictates that we have a responsibility to delete this data as soon as it is no longer needed for the original purpose stated in the Informed Consent Form. Hence, we must delete the interview recordings and transcripts as soon as we are reasonable confident we no longer need them.\nI propose that we delete the recordings after our paper has passed peer review, since it is plausible that we will want to refer to the original recording in case e.g. part of a transcription is identified as confusing or ambiguous, or we need to double check that published quotes, including the grammar, are faithful to the original recording.\nMicrosoft provide guidance on how to delete a recording on Teams."

The essential aim was to produce primary evidence from students’ perspectives that can be used by Course Organisers who are intending to update their programming courses to incorporate limited use of GenAI in a manner that is purposeful, responsible and critical.\nThe premise of our study is that the experiences and perspectives of the 2024 cohort of undergraduate students are (perhaps uniquely) rich in information that can help educators to navigate a path towards the explicit inclusion of GenAI in the teaching of introductory programming.\nProgramming courses in the School of Physics & Astronomy are heavily based on project work, either through formative mini-projects or larger projects tied to substantial fractions of the overall course credit. This study might also be framed as an inquiry into the use of GenAI for student-driven project work, albeit with the programming focus."

The interviews were then transcribed and coded; portions of text containing pertinent information were ‘tagged’ with one or more discrete codes that correspond to themes contained in the text, with a new code created every time a new theme is encountered."
