## Why...


## Who were the researchers?

... School of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh.

## Who funded this research?

The primary source of funding for this project was the Principle's Teaching Award Scholarship (PTAS) which funds teaching-related research at the University of Edinburgh.

JMR and SH were personally funded by PTAS.
In addition, JMR received funding from the School of Physics & Astronomy, and NGE received funding from ...summer scholarship.

We gratefully acknowledge that funding for this PTAS project was provided by the University of Edinburgh Development Trust.
Without this ongoing support PTAS would not be able to fund these projects which do so much for the quality of the student learning experience at the University of Edinburgh.
We would like to thank all alumni, staff and other donors who support the Development Trust, including through its unrestricted Edinburgh Fund.

## What software tools did you use?

We conducted interviews over Microsoft Teams, with the recordings saved to the University of Edinburgh's secure storage.

We wrote a [Python script](https://github.com/jmarshrossney/teams-transcript-formatter) to format the transcripts to make them human-readable.

We did the first round of coding using [QualCoder](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder), which is an open-source qualitative data analysis software (like NVivo) written in Python.

We then extracted the most useful quotes from the interviews and collaborated on a thematic analysis using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) (and GitHub).
You can find this analysis in this repository (TODO).

We wrote the paper using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project).

This website, and the presentation(s) were created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
You can browse the source for the website here. (TODO)
