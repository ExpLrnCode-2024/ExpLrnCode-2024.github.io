### Privacy considerations

Where research involves real human lives, there can be a tension between the transparency and reproducibility goals of the researcher, and the obligation to take every reasonable precaution to protect the privacy and security of the people involved.

We sought to strike a balance; we intend to publish a collection of the most relevant sections of interviews, after making certain to redact potentially identifiable or irrelevant information, but not the interviews in their entirety.

This is in line with the [informed consent form](jisc-surveys/participant_info.html) signed by all participants prior to their interview, which gives permission to publish _"sections of the interview"_ in _"research outputs and websites"_.

The full interview transcripts will **not** be made public at any time.

<!-- To discuss: do we believe that participants meaningfully consented to having their conversations analysed by an algorithm? I do not think so. Moreover it raises the likelihood of identifying an individual through mechanisms that would be considered a negligible risk otherwise. I am leaning towards believing we should not publish even the redacted set of quotes, but make them available upon request to researchers whose approach to research is compatible with this stance. -->
